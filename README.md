# group-project
This is our program that asks the user for their favorite number and their name. It takes the user's imput to the two questions and combines them into one statement.

In order to install our software, you can use the command git clone followed by the URL of the repository on JupyterLab. Since our code is written using Python, the file should end with .py so that it runs properly.
